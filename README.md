# SQLAlchemy_Part_2

This is part two of a multi-part assessment for creating a blogging app.  
A homepage has benn added that SHOULD display the five most recent posts (But I don't think it does)  
You can you add, edit, and delete posts for any given user.  
> Go to any user's page and you should find an option to add a post.  
> Click on a post's title to go to it's page
>> That's where you will find the option to edit or delete the post.
